# Copilot instructions for `scholtz/events`

## Repository structure
- Root repository currently contains the frontend app at `projects/events-frontend`.
- Main frontend source files are in `projects/events-frontend/src`.
- Views (page-level components) are in `src/views/`.
- Reusable components are in `src/components/`, organized by feature (e.g., `layout/`, `events/`).
- TypeScript type definitions are in `src/types/`.
- Pinia stores are in `src/stores/`.
- Global CSS styles and design tokens are in `src/assets/styles/main.css`.
- Vue Router configuration is in `src/router/index.ts`.

## Technology and conventions
- Frontend uses Vue 3 + TypeScript + Vite.
- State management uses Pinia with the Composition API (`defineStore` with `setup` function syntax).
- Routing uses Vue Router 5 with lazy-loaded route components (except the home page).
- Follow existing formatting conventions from `projects/events-frontend/.prettierrc.json`:
  - `semi: false`
  - `singleQuote: true`
  - `printWidth: 100`
- Keep changes minimal and scoped to the issue being solved.
- Use `<script setup lang="ts">` in all Vue single-file components.
- Use scoped styles (`<style scoped>`) in Vue components.
- Use CSS custom properties (variables) defined in `main.css` for theming/colors.
- Prefer semantic HTML elements and accessibility attributes.
- Use `@/` path alias for imports from the `src` directory.

## Validate changes
- Run commands from `projects/events-frontend`:
  - `npm run lint`
  - `npm run build`
- E2E tests use Playwright via `npm run test:e2e` (requires Playwright browsers to be installed).
